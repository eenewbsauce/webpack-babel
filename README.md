# webpack-babel
Messing around with Webpack and Babel

# setup

1. npm i
2. npm start -> builds using webpack w babel and runs it

# other scripts

1. `npm run build` -> builds the project using webpack and babel
2. `npm run quick-start1 -> starts the app without building
3. `npm run trans` -> just transpiles using babel
